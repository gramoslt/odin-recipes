    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>3 cups masa harina</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups warm water, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>
      Whisk masa harina and salt together; stir enough water into mixture until
      dough is smooth and holds together. Form dough into 2-inch balls. Flatten
      each ball to a 1/2-inch thick circle.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>
      Heat oil to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) in a deep-fryer or large
      saucepan.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>
      Fry dough in the hot oil until sopes are just lightly browned, about 30
      seconds per side. Remove sopes with tongs and place on a paper towel-lined
      plate; cool just until sopes can be handled. Pinch the edges of each sope
      together forming little 'boats'. Return to hot oil and fry until golden
      and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.
